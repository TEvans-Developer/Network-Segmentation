# Network-Segmentation
In this networking project we will be focusing on the security part of networking segmentation by implementing virtual local area network (VLAN). VLAN's are taking a single physical network and segmenting it into multiple logical networks. Each VLAN is then treated as a separate network. In this project we will focus on segmentating a company's network into  two different logical networks for its IT and Sales departments. We configure our VLANs using two different switches as well as a multilayer switch (layer 3 switch) for inter VLAN routing.
